# Playing-drums-in-air

The project is based on the concept of computer vision and image processing. You can play drum virtually, but need to use color tag properly. I have used black color. The code is taken from [here](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/AIR_Drums) for playing drums. Also, I have added some face insta filters just for fun.
